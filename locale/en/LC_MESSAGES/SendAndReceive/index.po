msgid "​为了保证你的资金安全，会再次让你核实下，发送交易是否有问题，你可以看到你要发送的这笔交易的目的地址，发送的金额，矿工费。这里详细解释下矿工费：矿工费是你发送这笔交易，是需要矿工把你的这个交易做到区块儿链中，矿工会收取一定的费用，比特派的发送和接收两个功能是不收任何手续费的。此外，由于区块儿有时会出现拥堵等情况，比特派专门设置了动态矿工费，这个动态矿工费是根据你发送的这笔交易的大小计算出来的最合适的矿工费费用。所以，我建议大家使用动态矿工费，防止交易长时间不确认等特殊情况。经常有用户反映，我钱包里有0.1个币啊，为什么我发送0.1个币却发送提示余额不够呢？应该考虑矿工费的，矿工费是从你余额里扣的，所以，尽量留足够的矿工费。"
msgstr "In order to secure your money, Bitpie will let you check it once again whether the transaction is no problem by seeing Destination, specific amount, and Miners’ Fee. Here is a detailed explanation about Miners’ Fee: it is charged because miners put your transaction in Blockchain after when you make this transaction; however the two functions – Send and Receive are free. In addition, there maybe is crowded in  Blockchain, so Bitpie has set the much more preferable Dynamic Miners’ Fee that is calculated according to the amount of the transaction. Consequently, I suggest that you use Dynamic Miners’ Fee to prevent special circumstances occurring in the transaction like a long time to trade or not to confirm. Some of you always reflect a situation: even though there is 0.1 Bitcoin in wallet, why would it show the balance is not enough to send 0.1 Bitcoin? Please don’t forget Miners’ Fee because Miners’ Fee is deducted from your balance. Please remain enough Miners’ Fee in wallet."

msgstr "Clicking the lower right '+' —Receive to show My Address interface. This is your wallet address. If would like to receive Bitcoin, you send it to your account address. Each time when you request a new address, there are ten new addresses, and meanwhile the old address can also be used, which you can find on my Address. What’s more, you can also press your old address for a long time to add it in Address Book, and then make a note to facilitate the next use."
